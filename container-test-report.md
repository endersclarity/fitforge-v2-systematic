## Executive Summary
- **Health Score**: 85.2%
- **Tests Run**: 27
- **Tests Passed**: 23
- **Critical Issues**: 5

## Test Categories

### ✅ What's Working
- Docker container is running and accessible
- All main routes return 200 OK
- Exercise data loads correctly
- UI renders without errors
- Performance is excellent (<500ms responses)

### ❌ What's Not Working
- Backend service is running but not connected
- Exercise equipment filters don't filter
- Data quality issues (muscle engagement >100%)
- Profile page has no form inputs

### 🔧 Recommendations
1. Fix exercise data muscle engagement totals
2. Connect equipment filter logic to UI
3. Either remove backend or connect it properly
4. Implement profile form
5. Add validation for data integrity

## Architecture Notes
The application has a disconnected backend service that's not being used. 
Frontend operates entirely on localStorage, making the backend redundant.
Consider either:
- Removing backend entirely (simplify)
- Or connecting it properly (for multi-device sync)

## Data Quality Issues
Critical: Exercise muscle engagement data sums to >100% for 37/38 exercises.
This will cause incorrect fatigue calculations.
