# Issue #26: Experimental Workout Builder with Drag-and-Drop

**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/endorpheus/fitforge-v2-systematic/issues/26
**Created**: 2025-06-27  
**Status**: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - TESTING IN PROGRESS

## Issue Analysis
### Problem Summary
Create a drag-and-drop workout builder at `/flows-experimental/workout-builder` that follows Fitbod's proven UX patterns for creating and organizing workouts. Current app has workout building scattered across multiple pages without cohesive flow.

### Root Cause Analysis  
No centralized workout creation interface - users can't intuitively build custom workouts with proper exercise grouping (supersets, warm-ups, etc.) and drag-and-drop organization.

### Impact Assessment
Users cannot create custom workouts efficiently, limiting the app's core functionality for workout planning and organization.

## DATA CONTRACT VERIFICATION âœ… (VERIFIED PRE-IMPLEMENTATION)

**Schema-First Development Evidence**:
- âœ… **Actual data verified**: `data/exercises-real.json` structure confirmed
- âœ… **Interface alignment checked**: TypeScript interfaces match data structure
- âœ… **Component contracts documented**: Props match data flow requirements

**Exercise Data Schema**: `data/exercises-real.json`
```typescript
interface Exercise {
  id: string;           // Verified: Unique identifiers exist
  name: string;         // Verified: Exercise names like "Pushup", "Chin-Ups"
  category: string;     // Verified: Categories defined
  equipment: string;    // Verified: Equipment types match EQUIPMENT_OPTIONS
  difficulty: string;   // Verified: Difficulty levels defined
  variation: string;    // Verified: Variation descriptions
  muscleEngagement: Record<string, number>; // Verified: Muscle engagement percentages
}
```

**Data Contract Match Verification**:
- âœ… **Exercise selector expects**: Exercise interface fields â†’ **MATCHES** actual data
- âœ… **Workout builder expects**: Exercise.id, Exercise.name â†’ **MATCHES** actual data  
- âœ… **Filter system expects**: Equipment/muscle values â†’ **MATCHES** via muscle-name-constants.ts

**Muscle Name Data Contract** (addresses filter issue #25):
- âœ… **Data names**: Used internally (e.g., "Pectoralis_Major") 
- âœ… **Display names**: Used in UI (e.g., "Chest")
- âœ… **Conversion functions**: dataToDisplayName(), displayToDataName()
- âœ… **Single source of truth**: `lib/muscle-name-constants.ts`

**Component Interface Verification**:
```typescript
// WorkoutExerciseData - VERIFIED matches Exercise data structure
interface WorkoutExerciseData {
  id: string;         // Generated from Exercise.id + timestamp
  exerciseId: string; // MATCHES Exercise.id
  name: string;       // MATCHES Exercise.name
  sets: number;       // Component-specific configuration
  reps: number;       // Component-specific configuration
  weight: number;     // Component-specific configuration
  // ... rest verified
}
```

**Contract Validation Status**: âœ… ALL VERIFIED - No data contract mismatches detected

### Step 6: Workout Template Management
**Files to modify**:
- Extend existing `lib/workout-template-service.ts`
- `components/workout-builder/SaveWorkoutModal.tsx` (new)

**Approach**:
- Save workout as template using existing service
- Name custom workouts
- A/B workout variation support

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
```typescript
interface WorkoutBuilderState {
  exercises: WorkoutExercise[]
  groups: ExerciseGroup[]
  workoutMeta: {
    name: string
    type: 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D'
    estimatedDuration: number
  }
}

interface WorkoutExercise {
  id: string
  exerciseId: string // References Exercise.id from data
  orderIndex: number
  sets: number
  reps: number
  weight?: number
  restTime: number
  groupId?: string
  notes?: string
}

interface ExerciseGroup {
  id: string
  type: 'superset' | 'timed-intervals' | 'warm-up' | 'cool-down'
  exerciseIds: string[]
  name?: string
}
```

### Data Flow
1. User clicks "Add an exercise" â†’ Opens exercise selector
2. User selects exercise â†’ Added to workout with default values
3. User configures sets/reps/weight â†’ Updates exercise state
4. User drags to reorder â†’ Updates orderIndex values
5. User groups exercises â†’ Creates ExerciseGroup and updates exerciseIds
6. User saves workout â†’ Converts to WorkoutTemplate format and saves

### UI Components Architecture
```
WorkoutBuilderPage
â”œâ”€â”€ WorkoutBuilderHeader (save, cancel, name)
â”œâ”€â”€ WorkoutCanvas
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ EmptyState (when no exercises)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ExerciseList
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DraggableExercise[]
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ExerciseCard
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SetRepControls
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GroupingBadge
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SupersetGroup[]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AddExerciseButton
â”œâ”€â”€ ExerciseSelectorModal
â””â”€â”€ SaveWorkoutModal
```

## Reference Flow Analysis

### Primary Flow: Adding an Exercise (6 screens)
- Screen 0: Workout view with "Add an exercise" button
- Screen 1-2: Exercise browser with filtering
- Screen 3: Multi-select with "Group as..." option
- Screen 4: Grouping options modal (Superset, Timed Intervals, Warm-up, Cool-down)
- Screen 5: Updated workout with grouped exercises

### Superset Creation (4 screens)
- Visual superset indicators with "4 ROUNDS" label
- Grouped exercises shown together
- Drag handle for reordering

### Key UX Patterns to Follow
1. **Visual Grouping**: Clear indicators for supersets, warm-ups, etc.
2. **Inline Editing**: Sets/reps/weight editing without modal
3. **Drag Handles**: Clear affordances for reordering
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple interface that reveals complexity as needed
