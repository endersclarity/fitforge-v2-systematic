# Issue #25: Experimental Exercise Browser with Fitbod-Style Filtering

**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/endersclarity/fitforge-v2-systematic/issues/25
**Created**: 2025-06-27
**Status**: TESTING

## Issue Analysis
### Problem Summary
Need to create an experimental exercise browser that follows Fitbod's proven UX patterns. This addresses the core problem where equipment filters were implemented on orphaned pages (`/exercises/[muscleGroup]`) that users can't reach through normal navigation.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Current app built features in isolation without cohesive user flows
- Exercise filtering exists but isn't accessible where users actually select exercises
- Need flow-based architecture following proven Fitbod patterns

### Impact Assessment
- Users cannot find or use the equipment filtering feature
- Exercise selection is fragmented across different pages
- Poor user experience due to disconnected flows

## Task Breakdown
- [x] Task 1: Create experimental directory structure and landing page
- [x] Task 2: Implement exercise browser page with proper layout
- [x] Task 3: Integrate existing filter components (CleanFilterBar)
- [x] Task 4: Add exercise grid/list display with Fitbod patterns
- [x] Task 5: Implement sorting functionality (Alphabetical/Most Logged)
- [x] Task 6: Add exercise detail modal/view
- [x] Task 7: Connect to next flow (workout builder)
- [x] Task 8: Ensure mobile responsiveness
- [x] Task 9: Add navigation from main app

## Implementation Plan
### Step 1: Create Experimental Structure
**Files to create**: 
- `/app/flows-experimental/page.tsx` (landing page)
- `/app/flows-experimental/exercise-browser/page.tsx` (main browser)
**Approach**: 
- Create landing page explaining experimental flows
- Set up basic routing structure

### Step 2: Implement Exercise Browser Layout
**Files to modify**: `/app/flows-experimental/exercise-browser/page.tsx`
**Approach**: 
- Header with back navigation
- Title "Exercise Browser"
- Integrate CleanFilterBar at top
- Exercise grid below

### Step 3: Reuse Existing Components
**Components to integrate**:
- `CleanFilterBar` - already has equipment, muscle, group filters
- `FilterDropdown` - for dropdown functionality
- `SortDropdown` - for sort options (need to verify exists)
**Approach**: 
- Import and integrate existing filter components
- Connect filter state to exercise display

### Step 4: Exercise Display Grid
**Reference**: `/flows/workout/adding-an-exercise/all-exercises/`
**Features**:
- Exercise cards with name, equipment, thumbnail
- Tap to see exercise details
- Visual indicators for equipment needed
**Approach**:
- Create ExerciseCard component
- Grid layout responsive to screen size
- Load data from `/data/exercises-real.json`

### Step 5: Sorting Implementation
**Options**: 
- Alphabetically (A-Z)
- Most Logged (need to simulate or use placeholder)
**Approach**:
- Add sort state to component
- Implement sort functions
- Update exercise list based on sort selection

### Step 6: Exercise Detail View
**Reference**: `/flows/workout/adding-an-exercise/exercise-info/`
**Features**:
- Exercise name and description
- Muscle engagement visualization
- Equipment requirements
- Instructions/tips
**Approach**:
- Modal or slide-in panel
- Reuse muscle engagement data from exercise JSON

### Step 7: Navigation Integration
**Add links from**:
- Current dashboard → Experimental flows landing
- Landing page → Exercise browser
**Connect to**:
- Exercise browser → Workout builder (future Issue #26)

## Testing Strategy
### Functional Testing
- [x] All exercises display correctly
- [x] Equipment filtering works in real-time
- [x] Sorting changes exercise order properly
- [x] Exercise details show correct information
- [x] Navigation flows work correctly

### UI/UX Testing
- [x] Matches Fitbod visual patterns
- [x] Mobile responsive design
- [x] Smooth transitions and interactions
- [x] Filter state persists during session

### Integration Testing
- [x] Integrates with existing filter components
- [x] Exercise data loads correctly
- [x] Links from main app work

## Research Notes
### Existing Components Available:
1. **CleanFilterBar** - Complete filter implementation from Issue #19
   - Equipment filter
   - Target muscle filter
   - Group filter (Push/Pull/Legs/Abs)
   - Fatigue sort

2. **FilterDropdown** - Dropdown UI component
   - Portal-based for z-index
   - Multi-select capability
   - "Clear All" option

3. **Exercise Data** - `/data/exercises-real.json`
   - 38 exercises with full data
   - Categories: BackBiceps, ChestTriceps, Legs, Abs
   - Equipment types: Dumbbell, TRX, Pull-up_Bar, Bodyweight, etc.

### Fitbod UX Patterns to Follow:
1. **Filter Bar** (from flow screenshots):
   - "Filter by: Your available equipment" toggle
   - "Sort by: Alphabetically/Most Logged" dropdown

2. **Exercise Display**:
   - Clean cards with exercise names
   - Equipment indicators
   - Tap for details pattern

3. **Navigation**:
   - Clear back navigation
   - Connection to workout building flow
