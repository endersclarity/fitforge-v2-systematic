## 🔧 SANDY'S CLEANUP TASKS (Non-blocking but recommended)

### ⚠️ REMAINING TECHNICAL DEBT
- **Interface duplication**: `WorkoutExercise` repeated across 6+ files  
- **State complexity**: 20 useState variables (reduced but still high)
- **Prop coupling**: High prop counts between components

### 📋 SPECIFIC CLEANUP TASKS

#### Task 1: Consolidate Interfaces (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Move WorkoutExercise to shared schemas** (`schemas/typescript-interfaces.ts`) ✅ Already existed
- [x] **Update all component imports** to use shared interface ✅ 4 components updated
- [x] **Remove duplicate interface definitions** from individual components ✅ Duplicates removed
- [x] **Ensure interface consistency** across all components ✅ All use shared schema

**Result**: Reduced interface duplication from 10+ files to centralized schema

#### Task 2: Extract State Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Create useWorkoutSession hook** (workout state management) ✅ Created
- [x] **Create useSetLogging hook** (set-related state) ✅ Created
- [x] **Create useWorkoutProgress hook** (progress tracking state) ✅ Created
- [x] **Reduce useState count** in main component ✅ 20 → 0 useState variables

**Result**: Main component reduced from 490 → 237 lines (52% reduction!)

#### Task 3: Reduce Prop Coupling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Analyze high prop counts** (13-14 props per component)
- [ ] **Use context for shared state** where appropriate
- [ ] **Simplify prop interfaces** by grouping related props

#### Task 4: Verify Test Claims (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Run actual test verification** to confirm "9/9 passing"
- [ ] **Document test execution evidence** in PR

#### Phase 3: Separate Business Logic (PRIORITY 3)
- [ ] Extract workout flow logic to workoutService.ts
- [ ] Extract set management to setLoggingService.ts
- [ ] Extract exercise operations to exerciseService.ts

#### Phase 4: Split Into Focused PRs (FUTURE)
- [ ] PR 1: RPE rating feature only
- [ ] PR 2: Batch logging feature only
- [ ] PR 3: Exercise replacement only
- [ ] PR 4: Warm-up tracking only

### ✅ APPROVED ASPECTS TO MAINTAIN
- Excellent TypeScript interface design
- Good modal component separation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear git workflow

## Issue Analysis

### Problem Summary
Create an experimental workout execution flow at `/flows-experimental/workout-execution` that implements Fitbod's comprehensive set logging patterns with advanced features not yet available in the existing `/app/workout-execution` implementation.

### Root Cause Analysis  
The current `WorkoutLoggerEnhanced` component provides basic set logging and rest timers, but lacks sophisticated features like exertion ratings (RPE), quick actions for consistent sets, exercise replacement, and real-time muscle fatigue visualization that make Fitbod's workout experience superior.

### Impact Assessment
- **Users**: Will get access to advanced workout execution patterns for better training quality
- **UX**: Matches Fitbod's proven 15-screen set logging flow
- **Architecture**: Tests experimental features without disrupting existing functionality

## Key Missing Features (vs Current Implementation)

### ✅ Already Implemented in WorkoutLoggerEnhanced
- Set-by-set logging with large rep/weight input
- "Add Set" button functionality  
- Rest timer auto-start after sets
- Progress indicators (exercise X/Y, sets completed)
- Visual countdown display with customizable rest periods
- Audio alerts for timer completion
- Workout timer and completion tracking

### ❌ Missing Features to Implement
1. **Exertion Rating (RPE)**: Post-set difficulty rating scale (1-10)
2. **Log All Sets**: Quick action for consistent sets across exercises  
3. **Replace Exercise**: Mid-workout exercise substitution
4. **Add Warm-up Sets**: Track warm-up vs working sets separately
5. **Exercise Notes**: Per-set or per-exercise notes capability
6. **Real-time Muscle Fatigue**: Visual heat map using `useRealTimeMuscleVolume` hook
