# Issue #27: Experimental Workout Execution with Advanced Set Logging

**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/fitforge/fitforge-v2-systematic/issues/27
**Created**: 2025-06-27
**Status**: ADDRESS_FEEDBACK (Sandy Metz Review)

## üîÑ SANDY METZ REVIEW FEEDBACK (PR #35)

### ‚ùå CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATIONS
1. **MASSIVE COMPONENT (867 Lines)**: WorkoutExecutionExperimental violates "small, focused classes" principle
2. **COMPLEX STATE (15+ Variables)**: 15+ useState hooks violate Single Responsibility Principle  
3. **OVERSIZED PR (+2029 Lines)**: Too large for safe review and rollback

### üìã REQUIRED REFACTORING TASKS

#### Phase 1: Break Down Component (PRIORITY 1)
- [x] Extract WorkoutHeader component (56 lines) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Extract SetLoggingForm component (153 lines) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [ ] Extract WorkoutProgress component (<75 lines)  
- [ ] Extract ExerciseQueue component (<100 lines)
- [ ] Create container component (<100 lines)

**Progress**: 767 lines remaining (was 867) - 100 lines reduced (-12% reduction so far)

#### Phase 2: Extract State Management (PRIORITY 2)
- [ ] Create useWorkoutSession custom hook
- [ ] Create useSetLogging custom hook
- [ ] Create useWorkoutProgress custom hook
- [ ] Remove useState from main component

#### Phase 3: Separate Business Logic (PRIORITY 3)
- [ ] Extract workout flow logic to workoutService.ts
- [ ] Extract set management to setLoggingService.ts
- [ ] Extract exercise operations to exerciseService.ts

#### Phase 4: Split Into Focused PRs (FUTURE)
- [ ] PR 1: RPE rating feature only
- [ ] PR 2: Batch logging feature only
- [ ] PR 3: Exercise replacement only
- [ ] PR 4: Warm-up tracking only

### ‚úÖ APPROVED ASPECTS TO MAINTAIN
- Excellent TypeScript interface design
- Good modal component separation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear git workflow

## Issue Analysis

### Problem Summary
Create an experimental workout execution flow at `/flows-experimental/workout-execution` that implements Fitbod's comprehensive set logging patterns with advanced features not yet available in the existing `/app/workout-execution` implementation.

### Root Cause Analysis  
The current `WorkoutLoggerEnhanced` component provides basic set logging and rest timers, but lacks sophisticated features like exertion ratings (RPE), quick actions for consistent sets, exercise replacement, and real-time muscle fatigue visualization that make Fitbod's workout experience superior.

### Impact Assessment
- **Users**: Will get access to advanced workout execution patterns for better training quality
- **UX**: Matches Fitbod's proven 15-screen set logging flow
- **Architecture**: Tests experimental features without disrupting existing functionality

## Key Missing Features (vs Current Implementation)

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented in WorkoutLoggerEnhanced
- Set-by-set logging with large rep/weight input
- "Add Set" button functionality  
- Rest timer auto-start after sets
- Progress indicators (exercise X/Y, sets completed)
- Visual countdown display with customizable rest periods
- Audio alerts for timer completion
- Workout timer and completion tracking

### ‚ùå Missing Features to Implement
1. **Exertion Rating (RPE)**: Post-set difficulty rating scale (1-10)
2. **Log All Sets**: Quick action for consistent sets across exercises  
3. **Replace Exercise**: Mid-workout exercise substitution
4. **Add Warm-up Sets**: Track warm-up vs working sets separately
5. **Exercise Notes**: Per-set or per-exercise notes capability
6. **Real-time Muscle Fatigue**: Visual heat map using `useRealTimeMuscleVolume` hook

- [ ] Optimize for single-handed usage patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Base Structure Setup
**Files to create**:
- `/app/flows-experimental/workout-execution/page.tsx`
- `/components/workout-execution-experimental.tsx`
- `/components/rpe-rating-modal.tsx`
- `/components/exercise-replacement-modal.tsx`

**Approach**: 
- Start with existing `WorkoutLoggerEnhanced` as foundation
- Add experimental features incrementally
- Maintain compatibility with existing workout builder flow

### Step 2: RPE Integration
**Files to modify**:
- Extend `PerformedSet` interface to include `rpe: number`
- Create RPE rating component with visual scale
- Integrate into set completion flow

**Approach**:
