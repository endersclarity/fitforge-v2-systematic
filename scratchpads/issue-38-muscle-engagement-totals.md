# Issue #38: Fix Exercise Muscle Engagement Totals Exceeding 100%

**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/endersclarity/fitforge-v2-systematic/issues/38
**Created**: 2025-06-30
**Status**: PLANNING

## Issue Analysis
### Problem Summary
37 out of 38 exercises in `data/exercises-real.json` have muscle engagement percentages that total more than 100%. This breaks the core fatigue calculation algorithm since both `muscle-volume-calculator.ts` and `client-fatigue-analyzer.ts` divide engagement by 100, assuming the total equals 100%.

### Root Cause Analysis  
The exercise data was likely created without validation that muscle engagement percentages should sum to exactly 100%. This is a data quality issue that affects all downstream calculations.

### Impact Assessment
- **Volume Calculations**: Exercises contribute 1.1x to 3.15x more volume than intended
- **Fatigue Analysis**: Recovery predictions are completely wrong
- **Progressive Overload**: Targeting will be inaccurate
- **User Experience**: Users will see incorrect recovery times and workout recommendations

## Examples of Bad Data
- TRX Row: 315% total (worst case - 3.15x over-calculation)
- Dead Lifts: 275% total
- Stiff Legged Deadlifts: 250% total
- Shoulder Shrugs: 100% total (ONLY correct exercise)

## Task Breakdown
- [ ] Task 1: Create a script to normalize all muscle engagement percentages to 100%
- [ ] Task 2: Create validation test to ensure all exercises sum to 100%
- [ ] Task 3: Update the exercises-real.json file with normalized data
- [ ] Task 4: Verify fatigue and volume calculations work correctly after fix
- [ ] Task 5: Add data validation to prevent future issues

## Implementation Plan
### Step 1: Create Normalization Script
**Files to create**: `scripts/normalize-muscle-engagement.js`
**Approach**: 
- Read exercises-real.json
- For each exercise, calculate current total
- Scale all percentages proportionally so they sum to 100%
- Preserve relative muscle engagement ratios
- Write back to file

### Step 2: Create Validation Test
**Files to create**: `tests/e2e/issue-38.spec.ts`
**Approach**:
- Test that all exercises have muscle engagement totals of exactly 100%
- Test that volume calculations are correct after normalization
- Test that fatigue calculations are correct after normalization

### Step 3: Update Exercise Data
**Files to modify**: `data/exercises-real.json`
**Approach**:
- Run normalization script
- Verify output manually for a few exercises
- Commit the normalized data

### Step 4: Verify Calculations
**Files to test**: 
- `lib/muscle-volume-calculator.ts`
- `lib/client-fatigue-analyzer.ts`
**Approach**:
- Run tests to ensure calculations work correctly
- Check that volume contributions match expectations
- Verify fatigue scores are reasonable

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test normalization algorithm preserves ratios
- [ ] Test total always equals 100% after normalization

### Integration Tests  
- [ ] Volume calculator produces correct results
- [ ] Fatigue analyzer produces correct results

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Recovery dashboard shows reasonable fatigue levels
- [ ] Workout recommendations are appropriate

### Interaction Verification (CLAUDE MUST COMPLETE)
- [ ] Verify normalized data loads in exercise browser
- [ ] Check recovery dashboard calculations
- [ ] Confirm muscle heat map shows correct intensity

## Research Notes
Current muscle engagement structure:
```json
{
  "muscleEngagement": {
    "Muscle_Name": percentage_number
  }
}
```

All 30 unique muscle names found in data:
- Anconeus, Anterior_Deltoids, Biceps_Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis
- Core, Core_Stabilizers, Deltoids, Erector_Spinae, Gastrocnemius
- Glutes, Gluteus_Maximus, Grip_Forearms, Hamstrings, Hip_Flexors
- Latissimus_Dorsi, Levator_Scapulae, Obliques, Pectoralis_Major, Quadriceps
- Rear_Deltoids, Rectus_Abdominis, Rhomboids, Rotator_Cuff, Serratus_Anterior
- Shoulders, Soleus, Transverse_Abdominis, Trapezius, Triceps_Brachii

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] All exercises normalized to 100% total
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Volume calculations verified correct
- [ ] Fatigue calculations verified correct
- [ ] PR created and ready for review
- [ ] Issue can be closed
