# Development Guide: 8-Step Systematic Software Development

## Philosophy: Planning Mindset Over Vibe Coding

**Core Principle**: "You need to adopt the mindset of a thinker and let AI simply be the weapon that you wield to get things done."

### The Vibe Coding Problem Cycle
1. Come up with cool app idea
2. Start prompting without thinking
3. Get random features that miss the mark
4. Try undoing pieces you don't like
5. End up with janky app and bloated codebase
6. Run into errors, smash head against keyboard
7. Give up entirely, start new idea
8. **Repeat cycle, never finish anything**

### The Solution: Systematic 8-Step Process
Transform from "idea person" to systematic builder through detailed planning before any code generation.

## Step 1: MVP Planning & Feature Definition

### Goal
Get past vague ideas and turn them into concrete specifics. Spend time thinking through the MVP and what it should do.

### Persona Prompting Setup
- **Role**: SaaS founder with hyperfocus on problem-solving
- **Obsession**: More obsessed with the problem than the solution
- **Process**: Iterative brainstorming cycle with back-and-forth refinement

### Required Output Format

#### Core App Overview
- **Elevator Pitch**: 2-3 sentences describing the app
- **Problem Statement**: What specific problem does this solve?
- **Target Audience**: Primary and secondary users
- **Unique Selling Points**: What makes this different/better?
- **Platforms**: Web app, mobile, desktop, etc.

#### Feature Breakdown
For each MVP feature, define:
- **Feature Description**: What it does in 2-3 sentences
- **Requirements**: Technical and functional requirements
- **User Stories**: "As a [persona] I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
- **UX Considerations**: Step-by-step user journey
- **Non-functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability needs

#### Critical Questions Section
- Clarify ambiguous requirements
- Identify missing important elements
- Suggest new features that align with MVP scope
- Address technical constraints

### Key Principles
- **MVP Focus**: Don't add every feature you think the app might have someday
- **Problem-First**: Solve a concrete problem for real users
- **Scope Discipline**: Water gets muddied with overly technical specifications
- **Future-Proofing**: Build proper foundation for later expansion

### Success Criteria
- Clear, concrete feature list
- Specific user problems addressed
- Realistic scope for initial build
- No ambiguous requirements remaining

---

## Step 2: High-Level Technical Decisions

### Goal
Map each MVP feature to its required tech stack. Understand what needs to exist for the app to function.

### Process

- Can multiple users modify same data simultaneously?

### Benefits
- Clear relationship between code components
- Early identification of complex solutions
- Informed tradeoff decisions
- Prevents knee-deep development surprises

---

## Step 3: User Experience & User Stories

### Goal
Define how the app will make users feel and how they'll interact with features from point A to point B.

### Core Philosophy
"Great products make users feel a specific way about themselves or the world around them."

### Process
- **User Story Mapping**: Break down each feature into user interactions
- **Workflow Definition**: How users move through the app
- **State Identification**: Different states the app will be in
- **UX Guidelines**: Consistent design principles

### Required Output Format

#### User Stories by Feature
For each feature, define personas and interactions:
- **Persona Types**: Power user, visual person, curator, etc.
- **Story Format**: "As a [persona] I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
- **Interaction Patterns**: How they use the feature

#### UX/UI Considerations
- **Step-by-step user journey**: Bulleted workflow
- **Visual hierarchy**: How information is organized
- **Interaction patterns**: Click, drag, hover behaviors
- **Edge cases**: What happens when things go wrong

#### UX Guidelines
- Use breathable white space with strategic color accents
- Create visual hierarchies using negative space
- Don't overload users with too much information
- Use progressive information disclosure
- Ensure consistent interaction patterns

### Key Questions
- How does a user move through this workflow?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- How might the app state change based on their actions?
- What does their experience look like step-by-step?

---

## Step 4: Style Guides & State Designs

### Goal
Define what the UI looks like and how it behaves in different states.

### Two-Part Process

#### Part A: Style Guide Creation
- **Inspiration Gathering**: Use tools like Mobbin for design references
- **Color Palette**: Primary, secondary, accent colors
- **Typography**: Font choices, sizing, spacing
- **Component Styling**: Buttons, inputs, cards, etc.
- **Animation Guidelines**: Transitions, micro-interactions
- **Spacing System**: Margins, padding, layout grids

#### Part B: State Design Definition
For each screen/feature, define states:
- **Initial State**: Before user interaction
- **Focus State**: During user interaction
- **Loading State**: While processing
- **Success State**: After successful action
- **Error State**: When something goes wrong
- **Empty State**: When no data exists

### Required Output Format

#### Comprehensive Style Guide
- **Color System**: Complete palette with usage guidelines
- **Typography Scale**: Heading, body, caption text styles
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI element definitions
- **Animation Principles**: Timing, easing, physics
- **Spacing Rules**: Consistent measurement system

#### State-Specific Designs
For each feature state:
- **Visual Description**: How it looks
- **Interaction Behavior**: How it responds
- **Animation Details**: Transitions between states
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Screen reader, keyboard navigation

### Benefits
- Professional, polished final result
- Consistent user experience
- Detailed implementation guidance
- Prevents design decisions during coding

---

## Step 5: Technical Specifications

### Goal
Create detailed app architecture planning by merging all previous steps into cohesive technical document.

### Process
Take high-level plans and get to detailed implementation level without writing actual code.

### Required Output Format

#### High-Level Summary
- Executive summary of the entire system
- Tech stack overview
- Architecture approach
- Deployment strategy

#### System Architecture
- Component relationships
- Data flow diagrams
- External integrations
- Infrastructure requirements

#### Feature Implementation Details
For each feature:
- **Technical Requirements**: Specific implementation needs
- **Data Models**: Database schemas, object structures
- **API Endpoints**: Internal and external service calls
- **Component Architecture**: Frontend component breakdown
- **State Management**: How data flows through the app

#### Additional Sections
- **Data Architecture**: Database design, relationships
- **Security & Privacy**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Design System Integration**: How styling connects to components
- **Infrastructure & Deployment**: Hosting, CI/CD, monitoring

### Key Principle
This is the last chance to decide the future of how the app gets built. Skipping this gives too much autonomy to the language model.

### Token Management
Despite seeming overwhelming, well-structured specs are typically ~15,000 tokens - manageable for modern language models.

---

## Step 6: Rules & Best Practices

### Goal
Establish guard rails and coding standards before implementation begins.

### Process
- **Framework-Specific Rules**: Best practices for chosen tech stack

- **Security Practices**: Authentication, data validation, error handling
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit, integration, end-to-end coverage

### Implementation
Copy relevant best practices into your prompt system as context for code generation phase.

---

## Step 7: Task Planning & Optimization

### Goal
Create detailed, step-by-step implementation plan that retains all planning details.

### Process Overview
- **High Context Window**: Use models with large context capacity
- **Detailed Granularity**: Don't lose the planning details
- **Evaluator-Optimizer**: Self-evaluation and improvement cycle
- **Phase-Based Planning**: Break into logical implementation phases

### Required Input Context
- **Technical Specification**: From Step 5
- **Project Rules**: From Step 6  
- **Core Application Intent**: From Step 1

### Task Planning Format
```
Phase X: [Phase Name]
├── Step X.1: [Specific Task]
│   ├── Technical Requirements
│   ├── Dependencies
│   └── UX/UI Considerations
├── Step X.2: [Specific Task]
└── Step X.3: [Specific Task]
```

### Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow

#### Initial Planning
Generate comprehensive step-by-step plan based on all previous specifications.

#### Self-Evaluation Questions
1. "How well did you account for all pieces of the tech stack?"
2. "How well did you consider dependencies between different steps?"
3. "How well did you account for different states of each screen?"
4. "What specific gaps exist between this plan and the original specification?"

#### Optimization Cycle
1. **Evaluate**: Compare plan against original specifications
2. **Identify Gaps**: Find missing elements or insufficient detail
3. **Regenerate**: Update plan incorporating identified improvements
4. **Repeat**: Continue until plan comprehensively covers all specifications

#### UX/UI Integration
Add UX/UI section to each step specifying:
- Critical UX considerations for that implementation step
- State-specific requirements
- Design system integration points

### Success Criteria
- Every specification requirement addressed
- Clear dependencies between steps
- UX/UI considerations integrated
- Implementation order optimized

---

## Step 8: Code Generation & Implementation

### Goal
Execute the detailed plan step-by-step while maintaining quality and context.

- **Context Integration**: Include relevant specification files
- **Quality Validation**: Test between phases
- **Iterative Improvement**: Refine based on results

#### Context Management
- **Reference Files**: Include style guides, specifications as needed
- **Previous Work**: Build on completed components
- **Consistency Checks**: Ensure alignment with established patterns

#### Skill-Level Adaptation
- **Beginners**: Smaller chunks, request explanations, understand each step
- **Experienced**: Larger prompt chunks, faster iteration
- **Universal**: Test between phases, validate before proceeding

### Implementation Workflow

#### For Each Task
1. **Copy Task**: From detailed planning document
2. **Add Context**: Include relevant specification files
3. **Execute**: Pass to coding tool with clear instructions
4. **Validate**: Test the implementation
5. **Understand**: Review what was built (especially for beginners)
6. **Next Task**: Move to subsequent step

#### Quality Assurance
- **Immediate Testing**: Validate each step before proceeding
- **Code Review**: Understand what's being built
- **Error Handling**: Address issues before they compound
- **Documentation**: Keep track of decisions and changes

#### Continuous Evaluation
Use evaluator-optimizer approach during implementation:
- "How well does this match the original specification?"
- "What's missing from this specific feature?"
- "How can this be improved based on the plan?"

### Success Principles
- **Understand Your Limitations**: Work within your skill level
- **Maintain Context**: Keep specifications accessible throughout
- **Test Frequently**: Catch issues early
- **Stay Focused**: Follow the plan, resist scope creep

*Complete methodology from the original video that formed the basis of this template*

### Introduction: Breaking the Vibe Code Cycle

The traditional "vibe code" process creates a destructive cycle:
1. Come up with cool app idea
2. Start prompting without thinking
3. Get random features that miss the mark
4. Try undoing pieces you don't like
5. End up with janky app and bloated codebase
6. Try to undo, run into errors
7. Smash head against keyboard, give up
8. Repeat with new idea, never finishing anything

**Solution**: Adopt a planning mindset. Let AI be the weapon you wield, but YOU do the thinking and creativity.

### Step 1: MVP Planning & Feature Definition

**Goal**: Get past vague ideas and turn them into concrete specifics. Poor or absent planning stems from this stage.

**Process**: 
- Start with persona prompting (SaaS founder obsessed with problem-solving)
- Provide core app idea and MVP understanding
- Use iterative brainstorming cycle - integrate answers and regenerate entirely new output each time

**Required Output Format**:
- Elevator pitch
- Problem statement
- Target audience
- Unique selling point
- Platforms to build on
- First batch of features with requirements and user stories
- UX considerations
- Non-functional requirements (speed, security, monetization)
- Critical questions for clarification

**Guidelines**:
- Clarify ambiguous things
- Don't skip important details
- Suggest new features not in initial MVP thought
- Focus on smallest version that's still functional and valuable

**Key Principle**: MVP = Most basic version that would still be valuable to somebody. Don't put in every feature you think it might have someday - water gets muddied and you end up with overly technical specification that's too much to manage.

### Step 2: High-Level Technical Decisions

**Goal**: Map each MVP feature to specific technologies. Understand what needs to exist for the app to function.

**Process**:
- Feature-Tech Mapping: Attach tech stack to each feature
- System Architecture: Visual diagram showing how components connect
- Technology Decisions: Frontend, backend, database, deployment choices
- Infrastructure Planning: CDN, queuing, scaling considerations

**Required Output Format**:

#### Feature-by-Feature Analysis
For each feature:
- 2-3 sentence summary of what the feature does
- Bulleted list of tech involved in the feature
- Main requirements for implementation

#### System Diagram
Visual representation showing:
- How components connect
- Data flow between systems
- External service integrations
- Infrastructure requirements

#### Technical Considerations
- Performance requirements
- Scalability planning
- Security implications
- Integration complexities

**Key Decisions to Make**:
- Will there be rate limiting?
- How many users are expected?
- What type of media can be uploaded?
- How will data be stored?
- Can multiple users modify same data simultaneously?

**Benefits**:
- Clear relationship between code components
- Early identification of complex solutions
- Informed tradeoff decisions
- Prevents knee-deep development surprises

**Recommendation**: Decide tech stack before entering this stage. Ask AI to recommend missing pieces if needed.

### Step 3: User Experience & User Stories

**Goal**: Define how the app will make users feel and how they'll interact with features from point A to point B.

**Process**: Take features and ask AI to think through different user stories and how the app might change based on user interactions.

**Required Output Format**:

#### User Stories
For each feature:
- Different user personas and their interactions
- "As an X, I want to Y, so that Z" format
- Step-by-step user journey
- What their workflow looks like as a user
- How things change along the way

#### UX/UI Considerations
- Visual hierarchy: How information is organized
- Interaction patterns: Click, drag, hover behaviors
- Edge cases: What happens when things go wrong

#### UX Guidelines
- Use breathable white space with strategic color accents
- Create visual hierarchies using negative space
- Don't overload users with too much information
- Use progressive information disclosure
- Ensure consistent interaction patterns

**Key Questions**:
- How does a user move through this workflow?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- How might the app state change based on their actions?
- What does their experience look like step-by-step?

### Step 4: Style Guides & State Designs

**Goal**: Define what the UI looks like and how it behaves in different states.

#### Two-Part Process

**Part A: Style Guide Creation**
- **Inspiration Gathering**: Use tools like Mobbin for design references
  - Find apps/websites from successful companies
  - Download 10+ screens that aesthetically catch your eye
  - Upload inspiration images to Claude along with app context
- **Color Palette**: Primary, secondary, accent colors
- **Typography**: Font choices, sizing, spacing
- **Component Styling**: Buttons, inputs, cards, etc.
- **Animation Guidelines**: Transitions, micro-interactions
- **Spacing System**: Margins, padding, layout grids

**Part B: State Design Definition**
For each screen/feature, define states:
- **Initial State**: Before user interaction
- **Focus State**: During user interaction (subtle purple glow, real-time validation)
- **Loading State**: While processing (circles with gradient colors rotating)
- **Success State**: After successful action (modal slides up, content slides in)
- **Error State**: When something goes wrong (red shake, validation messages)
- **Empty State**: When no data exists

#### Required Output Format

**Comprehensive Style Guide**:
- Color System: Complete palette with usage guidelines
- Typography Scale: Heading, body, caption text styles
- Component Library: Reusable UI element definitions
- Animation Principles: Timing, easing, physics
- Spacing Rules: Consistent measurement system

**State-Specific Designs**:
For each feature state:
- Visual Description: How it looks
- Interaction Behavior: How it responds
- Animation Details: Transitions between states
- Accessibility Considerations: Screen reader, keyboard navigation

**Detailed Example - Registration Flow**:
- **Initial**: Placeholder text, social login buttons
- **Focus**: Purple glow, real-time validation, green check/red shake
- **Loading**: Grayed out inputs, rotation animation
- **Success**: Modal content slides up, fades out, new content slides in from bottom

**Benefits**:
- Professional, polished final result
- Consistent user experience
- Detailed implementation guidance
- Prevents design decisions during coding

**Note**: Many people skip the design steps and just ask for designs in technical specifications stage. You can do that, but you won't get nearly the level of detail from this separate exercise.

### Step 5: Technical Specifications

**Goal**: Create detailed app architecture planning by merging all previous steps into cohesive technical document.

**Process**: Take high-level plans and get to detailed implementation level without writing actual code.

#### Required Output Format

**High-Level Summary**:
- Executive summary of the entire system
- Tech stack overview
- Architecture approach
- Deployment strategy

**System Architecture**:
- Component relationships
- Data flow diagrams
- External integrations
- Infrastructure requirements

**Feature Implementation Details**:
For each feature:
- **Technical Requirements**: Specific implementation needs
- **Data Models**: Database schemas, object structures
- **API Endpoints**: Internal and external service calls
- **Component Architecture**: Frontend component breakdown
- **State Management**: How data flows through the app

**Additional Sections**:
- Data Architecture: Database design, relationships
- Security and Privacy: Authentication, data protection
- External Integrations: Third-party services, APIs
- Design System Integration: How UI components connect
- Infrastructure and Deployment: Hosting, CI/CD, monitoring

**Key Details to Include**:
- Instead of "sidebar collapses/expands", specify which Next.js components to use
- How Tailwind integrates for styling
- Where Framer Motion comes into play for animations
- Specific data models for each feature
- Pseudo code examples (not full code yet)

**Critical Importance**: If you don't go through this stage, you give huge level of autonomy and control to the language model to decide what this app is going to be. This stage decides the future of how the thing gets built and whether it's good.

### Step 6: Rules & Best Practices

**Goal**: Set up guard rails before implementation. This is project-dependent based on frameworks and technologies you're using.

**Process**:
- Find framework-specific best practices (e.g., playbooks.com for Next.js rules)
- Copy relevant rules for your tech stack
- Include in prompt system for implementation phase

**Examples**:
- Next.js best practices if building React app
- React Native rules if building mobile app
- Specific to whatever framework/tools you're using

**Purpose**: Ensure implementation follows established patterns and avoids common pitfalls.

### Step 7: Task Planning & Optimization

**Goal**: Create detailed step-by-step plan that retains high degree of granularity from all previous steps.

#### Process: Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow

**Step 1: Initial Task Breakdown**
- Use high context window language model (like Gemini)
- Break down into individual tasks by section
- Create comprehensive step-by-step list
- Include all details from technical specification

**Step 2: Evaluation & Optimization**
- Ask AI to evaluate its plan against original specification
- Prompt: "Evaluate your plan against the original tech specification. Update your output giving me fresh end-to-end output that covers everything based on the following:
  - How well did you account for all pieces of the tech stack?
  - How well did you consider dependencies between different steps?
  - How well did you account for different states of each screen?"

**Step 3: Iterative Refinement**
- Repeat evaluation for specific areas (UX/UI, state management, etc.)
- Add sections like "UX/UI" to each step with critical considerations
- Continue until all original requirements are captured

#### Required Context Inputs
- Technical specification document (from Step 5)
- Critical project rules (from Step 6)
- Core application intent (elevator pitch from Step 1)

#### Output Format
Phase-by-phase breakdown:
- Phase 1: Core project configuration and setup
- Phase 2: Authentication and user management
- Phase 3: Core application features
- ...continuing through deployment

**Each phase includes**:
- Specific step-by-step instructions
- Dependencies and order requirements
- UX/UI considerations for each step
- Technical implementation details

**Key Advantage**: This retains much more detail than MCP servers or task planning tools, which tend to drop context for large projects.

### Step 8: Code Generation & Implementation

**Goal**: Generate actual code step-by-step using the detailed task plan.

#### Recommended Approach: Step-by-Step Implementation

**Process**:
1. Take detailed task list from Step 7
2. Copy each individual step into coding tool (Claude Code, etc.)
3. Execute step-by-step rather than trying to do everything at once
4. Continue cycle until everything is built

**Step-by-Step Example**:
- Step 1: Initialize Next.js and install core dependencies
- Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS with full design system (reference style guide markdown)
- Step 3: Set up Prisma and connect to Supabase
- Step 4: Configure environment variables
- ...and so on

#### Important Context Management
When moving to each step:
- Pass relevant context from previous steps
- Reference style guide files when needed
- Include any specific requirements from technical specification

**Example Context Prompt**:
"Make sure to reference style guide markdown for creating the Tailwind CSS system"

#### Skill Level Recommendations

**For Beginners**:
- Give tasks in smaller chunks
- Try to understand what has been built after each step
- Ask system to explain new directories/files
- Test between different phases
- Don't give too many steps at once

**For Experienced Developers**:
- Can give larger prompt chunks
- More comfortable with complex workflows
- Better at debugging when things go off-rails

#### Key Implementation Tips
- Put rules in place for TypeScript handling (major time sink in example)
- Use evaluator-optimizer for missing features: "Here's the task-by-task plan you gave me and here's the original prompt. What do you think is missing with respect to this specific feature?"
- Iterate on individual features rather than trying to build everything at once

#### Final Result Expectations
The example in the transcript resulted in:
- Functional dashboard with professional design
- Complete CRUD operations for the core feature
- Database integration working properly
- Proper routing and navigation
- About 2 hours total implementation time (1.5 hours of which was TypeScript error fixing)

**Success Factors**:
- Proper planning prevents major implementation issues
- Step-by-step approach allows for course correction
- Evaluator-optimizer ensures requirements aren't missed
- Results in polished, professional application rather than basic prototype
