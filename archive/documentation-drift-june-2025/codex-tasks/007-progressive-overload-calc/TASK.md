# Task: Progressive Overload Calculator - MATH WIZARD

Build an algorithm that calculates PERFECT progression recommendations.

## Mission: Outsmart Physics
Create a system that:
- Analyzes workout history patterns
- Calculates optimal weight/rep progressions
- Considers plateau detection
- Handles different progression schemes
- Suggests deload timing
- Tracks strength curves

## Algorithm Challenges
- Linear vs non-linear progression
- Different progression rates per exercise
- Plateau detection and breakthrough strategies
- Deload timing and intensity
- Strength curve analysis
- Volume progression vs intensity progression

## Progression Models to Implement
- Linear progression (add weight weekly)
- Double progression (reps then weight)
- Percentage-based progression
- Auto-regulation based on performance
- Periodization patterns

## Data Inputs
- Historical workout performance
- Exercise difficulty curves
- User experience level
- Recovery patterns
- Strength ratios between exercises

## Deliverables
- `wild-deliverables/ProgressiveOverloadCalc.tsx`
- `wild-deliverables/progressionAlgorithms.ts`
- `wild-deliverables/plateauDetection.ts`
- `wild-deliverables/strengthCurves.ts`

## Research Targets
- Look up powerlifting progression methods
- Research scientific studies on progression
- Find strength curve data
- Check out periodization models

**MAKE IT SO SMART IT PREDICTS THE FUTURE.**
