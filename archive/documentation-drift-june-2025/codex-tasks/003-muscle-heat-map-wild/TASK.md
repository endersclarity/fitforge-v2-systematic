# Task: Muscle Heat Map Visualizer - GO ABSOLUTELY WILD

Build an interactive muscle diagram that shows real-time engagement. Make it SEXY.

## Mission: Visual Porn
Create an SVG muscle diagram that:
- Shows muscle engagement percentages as heat colors
- Updates in real-time when exercises are selected
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Hover effects showing exact percentages
- Maybe even 3D effects if you're feeling crazy

## Data Available
- `data/exercises.json` has muscle engagement percentages for 37 exercises
- Each exercise has `muscleEngagement: { "Chest": 75, "Triceps": 20, ... }`

## Go Wild With
- SVG animations
- Color gradients (cold blue â†’ hot red)
- Smooth transitions between exercise selections
- Interactive hover states
- Maybe rotating 3D muscle model?
- Sound effects? (kidding... unless?)

## Deliverables
- `wild-deliverables/MuscleHeatMap.tsx`
- `wild-deliverables/muscleSvgData.ts` (SVG paths)
- `wild-deliverables/heatMapUtils.ts` (color calculations)

## Research Suggestions
- Look up SVG muscle diagram libraries
- Research heat map color algorithms
- Find smooth animation libraries
- Check out interactive anatomy visualizations
