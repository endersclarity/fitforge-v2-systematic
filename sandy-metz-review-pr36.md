## üèóÔ∏è STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

### Code Organization
- [x] Files in appropriate locations
- [x] Naming follows project conventions  
- [x] Proper separation of concerns
- [x] Clear module boundaries

### Design Quality
- [x] Single Responsibility Principle
- [x] Interface clarity
- [ ] Appropriate abstractions
- [ ] Minimal coupling

### Code Smells Detected
- [ ] Long methods (>15 lines) - Recovery page component has 200+ lines
- [ ] Complex conditionals
- [ ] Duplicate code - MUSCLE_DISPLAY_NAMES duplicated
- [ ] High coupling

**Issues Found**: 
- MUSCLE_DISPLAY_NAMES duplicated in recovery/page.tsx:42-56 instead of using shared constants
- Recovery page component doing too much - mixing data fetching, transformation, and rendering
- No shared type definitions for MuscleRecoveryData interface

**Recommendations**: 
- Extract MUSCLE_DISPLAY_NAMES to shared constants file matching FITFORGE-ESSENTIAL-PRINCIPLES.md guidance
- Break down recovery page into smaller components
- Create shared types for muscle data interfaces

## ‚ö° BEHAVIORAL VERIFICATION

### üö® INTERACTIVE FEATURE VERIFICATION
- [x] Clicked buttons/filters actually work (not just "should work") 
- [x] Data contracts verified between components
- [x] Visual changes match data state changes
- [x] Evidence provided (test-evidence-issue-28.md)

### Functionality Testing
- [x] Code matches PR description
- [x] Edge cases handled appropriately
- [x] Integration points work correctly
- [x] No breaking changes

### Test Quality
- [ ] Tests written BEFORE implementation (tests added AFTER initial implementation - commit 783ab56 after 516244c)
- [x] Tests actually test user interactions
- [x] Test names clearly indicate intent
- [x] Evidence of manual verification provided

**Test Results**: 93% pass rate (13/14 tests passing) with 1 flaky Firefox test
**Gaps Identified**: Tests were written after initial implementation, violating test-first development

**üîç DATA CONTRACT CHECK**:
- Component sends: Scientific muscle names (Pectoralis_Major)
- Display layer expects: Display names mapping
- Match status: YES - proper transformation at render time

## üîß MAINTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT

### Code Clarity
- [x] Intent clear from code
- [x] Complex sections documented
- [x] New team member could understand
- [ ] Consistent with project patterns

### Long-term Health
- [ ] Appropriate abstractions
- [x] Handles likely future changes
- [x] Makes future work easier
- [ ] Technical debt minimized

**Maintainability Score**: Medium
**Key Concerns**: 
- Duplicated constants instead of shared source of truth
- Large component doing multiple responsibilities
- Missing shared type definitions

## üë• TEAM IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Knowledge Sharing
- [x] New patterns documented
- [x] Dependencies justified
- [x] No hidden complexity
- [x] Team can maintain this code

### Process Compliance
- [ ] Follows coding standards (violated test-first development)
- [x] Appropriate PR size
- [x] Clear commit messages
- [x] Proper change documentation

### Risk Assessment
- [x] Low risk of breaking changes
- [x] Clear rollback path
- [x] Right approach for the problem
- [x] Minimal blast radius

**Overall Risk Level**: Low
**Merge Recommendation**: REQUEST CHANGES üîÑ
