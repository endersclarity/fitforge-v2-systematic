# WorkoutLogger Component Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a comprehensive workout logging system for FitForge with progressive disclosure, real-time features, and mobile optimization.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Components Setup
- [ ] Create StepperInput component for weight/reps with 0.25 lb increments
- [ ] Create ExerciseSelector component with search and filtering
- [ ] Create SetLogger component for entering workout sets
- [ ] Create useWorkoutLogger custom hook for state management
- [ ] Create main WorkoutLogger component

### Phase 2: Progressive Disclosure Implementation
- [ ] Implement feature level detection from user profile
- [ ] Show basic weight/reps for beginners
- [ ] Add RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) after 3+ workouts
- [ ] Add rest timer after 10+ workouts
- [ ] Show volume calculations for feature_level >= 2

### Phase 3: Real-time Features
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates (immediate UI update)
- [ ] Add auto-save functionality after each set
- [ ] Add error recovery with retry logic
- [ ] Implement offline mode handling
- [ ] Add loading states using skeleton components

### Phase 4: Mobile Optimization
- [ ] Implement touch-friendly tap targets (min 44px)
- [ ] Add number pad support for inputs
- [ ] Implement swipe-to-delete for sets
- [ ] Create bottom sheet for exercise selection on mobile
- [ ] Test responsive design

### Phase 5: Exercise Data Integration
- [ ] Show recently used exercises first
- [ ] Display last performed weight/reps
- [ ] Add personal best indicators
- [ ] Implement exercise filtering by equipment/muscle group

## Technical Architecture

### Component Hierarchy
```
WorkoutLogger/
├── WorkoutLogger.tsx (main orchestrator)
├── ExerciseSelector.tsx (exercise search/select)
├── SetLogger.tsx (set entry form)
├── StepperInput.tsx (weight/reps input)
└── useWorkoutLogger.ts (state management)
```

### State Management
- Local state with React hooks
- Integration with API client for data persistence
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Error recovery and retry logic

### Evidence-First Debugging
- Console logs for all major operations
- Function entry/exit logging
- Data transformation logging
- Error condition detection

## File Locations
- Components: `/components/workout/`
- Hooks: `/hooks/`
- Validation: `/lib/`

### Implementation Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive WorkoutLogger component system for FitForge with the following components:

#### 1. **StepperInput Component** (`components/workout/StepperInput.tsx`)
- Touch-optimized numeric input with increment/decrement buttons
- Supports 0.25 lb weight increments and single rep increments
- Mobile-friendly with haptic feedback support
- Proper validation and normalization of values
- Responsive size variants (sm, default, lg)

#### 2. **ExerciseSelector Component** (`components/workout/ExerciseSelector.tsx`)
- Smart exercise search with filtering by equipment and muscle group
- Shows recently used exercises first with last performed stats
- Personal best indicators and performance history
- Mobile-optimized with bottom sheet on small screens
- Real-time search with optimized performance

#### 3. **SetLogger Component** (`components/workout/SetLogger.tsx`)
- Progressive disclosure based on user experience level
- Shows RPE after 3+ workouts, rest timer after 10+ workouts
- Smart defaults from previous sets
- Personal best detection and progress indicators
- Inline editing and deletion of sets
- Volume calculations for advanced users

#### 4. **useWorkoutLogger Hook** (`hooks/useWorkoutLogger.ts`)
- Comprehensive state management with optimistic updates
- Offline mode support with automatic retry
- Exercise history tracking with personal bests
- Error recovery and graceful degradation
- Performance optimized with memoization

#### 5. **WorkoutLogger Component** (`components/workout/WorkoutLogger.tsx`)
- Main orchestrator component with tabbed interface
- Real-time sync status and offline indicators
- Exercise grouping and workout summary
- Energy level tracking and workout notes
- Mobile-responsive design

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Basic weight/reps for beginners
   - RPE unlocked after 3 workouts
   - Rest timer after 10 workouts
   - Volume calculations for feature_level >= 2

2. **Real-time Features**
   - Optimistic updates for instant feedback
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Offline mode with sync queue
   - Connection status indicators

3. **Mobile Optimization**
   - 44px minimum touch targets
   - Number pad input support
   - Bottom sheet for exercise selection
   - Responsive layouts

4. **Evidence-First Debugging**
   - Comprehensive console logging
   - Function entry/exit tracking
   - Data transformation logging
   - Error condition detection

### Technical Achievements

- Type-safe implementation with full TypeScript coverage
- Follows FitForge design system (dark theme, custom components)
- Integrates seamlessly with FastAPI backend
- Handles edge cases and error states gracefully
- Performance optimized with React best practices

### Next Steps

The WorkoutLogger component system is now ready for integration into the main FitForge application. Consider:

1. Adding unit tests for components and hooks
2. Implementing E2E tests for critical user flows
3. Adding analytics tracking for user interactions
4. Enhancing with exercise recommendations based on fatigue data
5. Adding social features (sharing workouts, comparing with friends)
