## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues (GitHub Issues Created)

### 1. [Issue #38](https://github.com/endersclarity/fitforge-v2-systematic/issues/38): Exercise Data Quality
- **Problem**: 37/38 exercises have muscle engagement totals >100%
- **Impact**: Breaks all fatigue calculations - core feature
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Fix immediately

### 2. [Issue #39](https://github.com/endersclarity/fitforge-v2-systematic/issues/39): Equipment Filter Broken
- **Problem**: Filter UI works but doesn't filter results
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, feature appears broken
- **Priority**: HIGH - User-facing bug

### 3. [Issue #40](https://github.com/endersclarity/fitforge-v2-systematic/issues/40): Backend Architecture Confusion
- **Problem**: Backend running but completely unused
- **Impact**: Wasted resources, architectural confusion
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Needs decision

### 4. [Issue #41](https://github.com/endersclarity/fitforge-v2-systematic/issues/41): Profile Form Missing
- **Problem**: Profile page has no input elements
- **Impact**: Users cannot enter profile data
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Feature incomplete

### 5. [Issue #42](https://github.com/endersclarity/fitforge-v2-systematic/issues/42): Formalize Test Suite
- **Problem**: Need proper E2E tests to catch these issues
- **Impact**: Quality assurance
- **Priority**: HIGH - Prevent regressions

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run comprehensive container tests
node scripts/comprehensive-container-test.js

# Check exercise data quality
node scripts/detailed-functionality-tests.js

# Investigate specific failures
node scripts/investigate-failures.js
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix exercise data (Issue #38) - It's breaking core calculations
2. Fix equipment filter (Issue #39) - User-facing bug
3. Make backend decision (Issue #40)
4. Complete profile form (Issue #41)
5. Set up proper E2E tests (Issue #42)
