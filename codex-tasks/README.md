# Codex Tasks - FitForge Development

## Overview
This directory contains structured tasks for OpenAI Codex to work on asynchronously. Each task is self-contained with complete specifications, examples, and expected deliverables.

## Current Tasks

### ðŸ”¥ Active: 001-workout-logger
**Status**: Ready for development  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Build React component for logging workout sets with form validation, API integration, and TypeScript.

**Quick Start for Codex**:
```
cd codex-tasks/001-workout-logger
# Read TASK.md for complete specifications
# Place completed files in deliverables/ folder
```

## Completed Tasks
* 005-exercise-search-beast - Exercise Search Beast component

## Instructions for Codex

1. **Read the task specification** in the numbered folder (e.g., `001-workout-logger/TASK.md`)
2. **Review examples** in the `examples/` subfolder for code patterns and data structures
3. **Build the solution** following the technical requirements
4. **Place completed files** in the `deliverables/` subfolder
5. **Update this README** with completion status when done

## Evaluation Process

After Codex completes a task:
1. Claude Code will build the same component independently
2. Both implementations will be compared for quality, functionality, and approach
3. Best solution will be integrated into the main project
4. Results will be documented for future reference

## Project Context

**FitForge** is a sophisticated fitness tracking application with:
- Next.js 15 frontend with TypeScript
- FastAPI Python backend
- Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Scientific muscle engagement tracking
- Progressive overload analytics

The codebase follows systematic development methodology with comprehensive documentation, schema-first development, and production-ready practices.
