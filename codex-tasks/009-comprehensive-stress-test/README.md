# üî• CODEX TASK 009: COMPREHENSIVE STRESS TEST & DIAGNOSTIC

## üéØ MISSION: FULL SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC & USER EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS

**Difficulty**: EXTREME  
**Type**: Full-Stack Analysis & Bug Hunt  
**Internet Access**: REQUIRED for research and documentation  
**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours  

---

## üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

You are being hired as both a **Quality Assurance Engineer** and **Full-Stack Detective** to perform the most comprehensive analysis possible of the FitForge application. We need to know:

1. **What actually works end-to-end?**
2. **What's broken and why?**
3. **How good is the user experience?**
4. **What would a real user think?**
5. **Where are the technical gaps?**

---

## üß¨ DUAL-ROLE APPROACH

### üë§ ROLE 1: NAIVE USER
Act as someone who just discovered this fitness app and wants to log their first workout. You know nothing about the codebase.

### üîß ROLE 2: TECHNICAL INVESTIGATOR  
Simultaneously analyze the technical implementation, API calls, database interactions, and code quality.

---

## üöÄ PHASE 1: INFRASTRUCTURE REALITY CHECK

### Docker Environment Analysis
1. **Fix the npm dependency issue first**
   - The app currently fails to build due to `react-window-autosizer@^0.3.0` not existing
   - Research the correct package name and fix package.json
   - Document what you find and why this happened

2. **Get the full stack running**
   - Execute `./start-fitforge-v2-dev.sh`
   - Verify all 3 services start successfully:
     - Frontend: http://localhost:3001 (note: NOT 3000!)
     - Backend: http://localhost:8000
     - Database: PostgreSQL on 5432
   - Document any issues and how you resolved them

3. **Backend API Verification**
   - Test http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Try at least 5 different API endpoints manually
   - Check if database schema actually loaded
   - Verify FastAPI endpoints return expected data structures

---

## üé≠ PHASE 2: USER EXPERIENCE STRESS TEST

### Act Like a Real User (Document Everything!)

1. **First Impressions** (http://localhost:3001)
   - What do you see when you load the app?
   - Is it obvious what this app does?
   - Are there any JavaScript errors in browser console?
   - How does it look on mobile vs desktop?

2. **Core Workflow: Log Your First Workout**
   - Try to start a new workout
   - Can you add exercises?
   - Can you log sets with weight and reps?
   - Does the data persist between page refreshes?
   - Can you complete a workout?

3. **Navigation Stress Test**
   - Click every button, link, and interactive element
   - Try to break forms with invalid data
   - Test back button, refresh, direct URL navigation
   - Try rapid clicking, double clicks, edge cases

4. **Data Persistence Investigation**
   - Is data saved to localStorage, the backend, or both?
   - Does the frontend actually talk to the FastAPI backend?
   - Can you see your workout data in subsequent visits?

---

## üîç PHASE 3: TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE

### Frontend Analysis
1. **Component Integration**
   - Do the WorkoutLogger, ExerciseSelector, ProgressDashboard actually work?
   - Are there missing components or broken imports?
   - Test the muscle visualization and heat map features

2. **API Integration Reality Check**
   - Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Does the frontend make actual HTTP requests to localhost:8000?
   - Or is everything just localStorage/mock data?
   - Document the API call patterns you observe

3. **Error Handling**
   - What happens when the backend is down?
   - How does the app handle network failures?
   - Are error messages user-friendly?

### Backend Analysis
1. **Database Integration**
   - Connect to PostgreSQL directly
   - Check if tables were created correctly
   - Verify if any data is actually being saved
   - Test the schema matches the Pydantic models

2. **API Endpoint Reality Check**
   - Test each endpoint category: workouts, exercises, users, analytics
   - Do they return real data or errors?
   - Is authentication working?
   - Are the response schemas correct?

---

## üéØ PHASE 4: ADVANCED STRESS TESTING

### Performance & Edge Cases
1. **Load Testing**
   - Try to create 50+ exercises in a workout
   - Test with very large weight numbers (999 lbs)
   - Try logging 100+ sets
   - See what breaks first

2. **Data Validation Stress Test**
   - Try negative weights, zero reps, decimal increments
   - Test with special characters in exercise names
   - Try SQL injection attempts on any forms
   - Test XSS attempts

3. **Concurrency Testing**
   - Open multiple browser tabs
   - Try logging workouts simultaneously
   - Test data conflicts and race conditions

---

## üèÜ PHASE 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### Codex Implementation Review
1. **Find the Codex Branches**
   - Check `CODEX_REVIEW.md` for branch names
   - Review the "BETTER THAN FITBOD" and "MEDICAL TEXTBOOK QUALITY" implementations
   - Compare them to what's currently running

2. **Gap Analysis**
   - What features exist in Codex branches but not in main implementation?
   - Which approach is actually better for users?
   - What can be learned from each implementation?
