# Task 009 Diagnostic Report

This report summarizes a high-level analysis of the FitForge repository.

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Overall Health Score**: 2/10 (build fails, tests unavailable)
- **User Experience Rating**: N/A (frontend not running due to build failure)
- **Technical Implementation Score**: 3/10 (incomplete dependency resolution and integration gaps)
- **Recommendation**: Fix infrastructure and dependency issues before further feature work.

## 2. Infrastructure Findings
- `npm install` fails because `react-window-autosizer` does not exist in npm registry (should be `react-virtualized-auto-sizer`). This dependency is still referenced in `package.json`.
- No `node_modules` directory, so Jest and Playwright cannot run.
- Docker setup references port 3001 for the frontend (`docker-compose.fast.yml`), but repository scripts still default to 3000 in some places.

## 3. User Experience Analysis
- Unable to load `http://localhost:3001` locally due to build errors. Frontend status unknown.
- No manual testing possible without resolving dependencies.

## 4. Technical Audit
- Static review shows Next.js components for workout logging (`WorkoutLogger`, `ExerciseSelector`, etc.) but integration with API unverified.
- FastAPI backend exposes multiple routes (`/api/exercises`, `/api/workouts`, etc.) but requires database initialization. Connection details rely on environment variables.
- Unit and integration tests exist but cannot run without dependencies.

## 5. Bug Report
- **Critical**: Missing dependency `react-window-autosizer` prevents build.
- **Critical**: No automated test run due to missing modules.
- **Minor**: Port configuration mismatch between docs and scripts.

## 6. Feature Comparison
- Multiple workout logger implementations exist in branches according to `CODEX_REVIEW.md`. A thorough comparison requires building each branch.

## 7. Recommendations
1. Replace `react-window-autosizer` with `react-virtualized-auto-sizer` in `package.json`.
2. Run `npm install` and ensure all packages resolve.
3. Use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.fast.yml up` to verify containers start on ports `3001` and `8000`.
4. Execute the Jest and Playwright test suites once dependencies are installed.
5. Document observed API calls from the frontend to confirm real integration.
6. Compare Codex branches once a stable build is running.
