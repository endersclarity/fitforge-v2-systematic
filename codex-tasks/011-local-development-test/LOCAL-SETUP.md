# üîß LOCAL SETUP GUIDE FOR TASK 011

## üéØ GOAL: Test FitForge without Docker

### Environment Requirements:
- Node.js (any recent version)
- npm or yarn
- Python 3.11+ (optional for backend testing)
- Web browser with dev tools

---

## üöÄ FRONTEND SETUP (PRIMARY FOCUS)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/fitforge-v2-systematic

# Install Node.js dependencies (should work - we fixed react-window-autosizer)
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start Development Server
```bash
# Option 1: Use npm script
npm run dev:next

# Option 2: Direct Next.js command
npx next dev

# Option 3: Alternative port if 3000 is busy
npx next dev -p 3001
```

### Expected Result:
- Development server starts on http://localhost:3000 (or specified port)
- Should see "FitForge" application load
- No build errors in terminal

---

## üéØ WHAT TO TEST

### 1. Initial Load & Navigation
- Does the dashboard load without errors?
- Can you navigate between pages?
- Are there JavaScript console errors?

### 2. Core Functionality
- **Dashboard**: Stats, charts, recent workouts
- **Workout Creation**: Can you start a new workout?
- **Exercise Selection**: Browse and select exercises
- **Set Logging**: Enter weight, reps, complete sets

### 3. Data Persistence
- Does data persist between page refreshes?
- Is localStorage being used effectively?
- Can you build up workout history over time?

---

## üîç TESTING APPROACH

### User Experience Focus:
1. **Act like a real user** - try to log a complete workout
2. **Test edge cases** - invalid inputs, rapid clicking
3. **Evaluate polish** - does it feel professional?
4. **Compare to real apps** - how does UX stack up?

### Technical Analysis:
1. **Component quality** - well-structured React code?
2. **State management** - clean data flow?
3. **Error handling** - graceful failure modes?
4. **Performance** - responsive and fast?

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### What Won't Work (Expected):
- **Backend API calls** - no real database integration
- **Authentication** - likely using mock/localStorage
- **Advanced analytics** - may be placeholder data
- **Real-time features** - probably simulated

### What SHOULD Work:
- **Frontend interface** - complete React application
- **Workout logging** - localStorage-based persistence
- **Exercise database** - local JSON data
- **Navigation** - client-side routing
- **Basic analytics** - calculated from local data

## üé≠ TESTING PERSONAS

### 1. Complete Beginner
- First time using any fitness app
- Needs clear onboarding and guidance
- Easily confused by complex interfaces

### 2. Experienced Gym-Goer
- Familiar with workout tracking
- Wants efficient, fast logging
- Expects advanced features

### 3. Power User
- Uses multiple fitness apps
- Wants data export and analytics
- Notices UI/UX details and polish

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### If npm install fails:
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall
npm install
```

### If dev server won't start:
```bash
# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :3000

# Try alternative port
npx next dev -p 3001
```

### If components don't load:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all dependencies installed correctly
- Check for TypeScript compilation errors

---

## üéØ FOCUS AREAS

### Primary Assessment Questions:
1. **Does this feel like a professional fitness app?**
2. **Can users actually accomplish their workout tracking goals?**
3. **How does the code quality compare to your implementations?**
4. **What improvements would make the biggest impact?**

### Secondary Investigations:
1. **Architecture decisions** - are they justified?
2. **Component reusability** - well-designed system?
3. **Performance characteristics** - fast and responsive?
4. **Accessibility considerations** - usable for all users?

---

**Remember**: Focus on what you CAN test effectively - the frontend user experience, code quality, and overall approach. Don't worry about Docker/backend integration that you can't access.
