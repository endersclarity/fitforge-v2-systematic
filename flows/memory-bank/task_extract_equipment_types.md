# Task: Extract Equipment Types from Exercise Database
**Parent:** `implementation_plan_equipment_filtering.md`

## Objective
Analyze the exercise database to identify all unique equipment types and create TypeScript enum/constants for consistent equipment filtering implementation.

## Context
The exercises-real.json file contains 38 exercises with equipment field values. Need to extract unique equipment types to build the filtering interface and ensure type safety throughout the application.

## Steps
1. Read `/data/exercises-real.json` and extract all unique equipment values
2. Analyze equipment naming patterns for consistency (e.g., "Pull-up_Bar" vs "Pull-up Bar")
3. Create TypeScript equipment enum in `/schemas/typescript-interfaces.ts`
4. Add equipment validation to existing Exercise interface
5. Create utility function for equipment filtering in `/lib/data-service.ts`
6. Document equipment types and their usage patterns

## Dependencies
- Requires: exercises-real.json (existing), typescript-interfaces.ts (existing)
- Blocks: Create Filter UI Component, Integrate Filter Logic

## Expected Output
- Updated TypeScript interfaces with Equipment enum
- Utility functions for equipment-based exercise filtering
- Documentation of available equipment types and filtering patterns
