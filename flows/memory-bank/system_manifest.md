# System: FitForge V2 Systematic

## Purpose
Sophisticated personal workout tracker with muscle fatigue analytics, progressive overload targeting, and comprehensive UI flow analysis from Fitbod patterns.

## Module Registry
- [Components (`components_module.md`)]: UI components and visualizations with Fitbod styling
- [Data Management (`data_module.md`)]: Exercise database and workout tracking systems
- [AI Analytics (`ai_analytics_module.md`)]: Fatigue calculation and progressive overload algorithms
- [Flow Analysis (`flows_module.md`)]: Mobbin pattern library and UI reference system
- [Backend Services (`backend_module.md`)]: Python FastAPI with comprehensive testing

## Development Workflow
1. Reference flow patterns for UI consistency
2. Implement systematic feature development via HDTA structure
3. Test with comprehensive Jest/Playwright suite
4. Validate with real exercise data and analytics
5. Document architectural decisions in memory-bank
