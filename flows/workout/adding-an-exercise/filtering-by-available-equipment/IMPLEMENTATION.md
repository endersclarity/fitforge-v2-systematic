# Equipment Filtering Implementation

**Phase**: Active Development  
**Flow Reference**: This directory contains Fitbod UI patterns for equipment filtering  
**Parent Plan**: [memory-bank/implementation_plan_equipment_filtering.md](../../../../memory-bank/implementation_plan_equipment_filtering.md)

---

## üéØ **Current Objective**
Implement equipment filtering for exercise selection following Fitbod UI patterns. Users can toggle "Your available equipment" to filter exercises by what's actually available.

---

## üìã **Task Progress**

### ‚úÖ Phase Setup
- [x] HDTA scaffolding complete
- [x] Flow patterns analyzed (4 Fitbod screenshots)
- [x] Implementation plan created
- [x] Task decomposition defined

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Extract Equipment Types (COMPLETED)
- [x] Read `/data/exercises-real.json` and extract unique equipment values
- [x] Analyze equipment naming patterns for consistency  
- [x] Create TypeScript equipment enum in `/schemas/typescript-interfaces.ts`
- [x] Add equipment validation to existing Exercise interface
- [x] Create utility function for equipment filtering in `/lib/equipment-filter.ts`
- [x] Document equipment types and usage patterns

**Results:**
- **7 Equipment Types**: Dumbbell (11), Bench (7), Bodyweight (5), TRX (5), Pull-up_Bar (4), Kettlebell (4), Plybox (1)
- **TypeScript Types**: `EquipmentType`, `EQUIPMENT_TYPES`, `EQUIPMENT_OPTIONS`
- **Utility Functions**: `filterExercisesByEquipment()`, `getUniqueEquipmentTypes()`, equipment presets
- **localStorage Support**: Save/load user equipment preferences

### ‚è≥ Task 2: Create Filter UI Component (PENDING)
- [ ] Build toggle interface matching Fitbod patterns
- [ ] Implement "Your available equipment" toggle
- [ ] Add "Sort by" options (Alphabetically, Most Logged)
- [ ] Style with existing Calm design tokens

### ‚è≥ Task 3: Integrate Filter Logic (PENDING)
- [ ] Connect filtering to exercise selection components
- [ ] Update exercise display based on equipment availability
- [ ] Implement real-time filtering

### ‚è≥ Task 4: Add State Persistence (PENDING)
- [ ] Save equipment preferences to localStorage
- [ ] Restore user equipment settings on app load

## üì± **Fitbod Pattern Analysis**

**UI Elements from Flow Screenshots:**
- **Tabs**: "All" | "By Muscle" | "Categories"  
- **Filter Section**: "Filter by" with "Your available equipment" toggle
- **Sort Section**: "Sort by" with "Alphabetically" vs "Most Logged" options
- **Exercise List**: Filtered in real-time based on equipment availability

**Key UX Patterns:**
- Toggle is prominent and clearly labeled
- Filtering happens immediately when toggle is activated
- Exercise list updates dynamically
- Sort options work independently of filtering

---

## üíª **Implementation Notes**

### Equipment Types Expected:
- Dumbbell
- TRX  
- Pull-up_Bar
- Bodyweight
- Cable
- Barbell
- (To be confirmed from actual data)

### Technical Approach:
1. **Data Layer**: Extract equipment enum from real exercise data
2. **UI Layer**: Toggle component matching Fitbod styling
3. **Logic Layer**: Client-side filtering for immediate response
4. **Persistence**: localStorage for user preferences
