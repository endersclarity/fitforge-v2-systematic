# 🚨 FitForge Enforcement Summary

## What Changed

### /issue Command Enhancements
1. **Phase 0 - Schema Verification** (NEW)
   - MANDATORY data contract verification before any coding
   - Must document exact field names and types
   - Prevents "Chest" vs "Pectoralis_Major" mismatches

2. **Phase 2A/2B/2C - Hard Gates** (NEW)
   - 2A: Create tests FIRST with verification gate
   - 2B: Verify data contracts in tests
   - 2C: Implementation gate - can't code until tests fail properly

3. **Pre-Commit Verification** (NEW)
   - Tests must exist and pass before commits allowed
   - Automated check prevents "commit now, test later"

4. **Pre-PR Verification Gate** (NEW)
   - Automated script checks all requirements
   - Blocks PR creation if tests missing or failing

5. **Final Verification Gate** (NEW)
   - Automated verification script runs
   - Screenshots and evidence generated automatically

### /pr-review Command Enhancements
1. **Phase 0 - Automated Verification** (NEW)
   - Runs verify-issue-gates.sh automatically
   - Checks test-first compliance
   - Immediate REQUEST CHANGES if violations found

2. **Interactive Feature Verification** (ENHANCED)
   - Explicit checks for "clicked and it works"
   - Data contract verification required
   - No "trust me" - evidence required

3. **Automated Enforcement** (NEW)
   - Automatic REQUEST CHANGES for:
     - No test files
     - Tests written after implementation
     - No evidence for interactive features

### New Automated Scripts
1. **verify-issue-gates.sh**
   - 6 verification gates
   - Schema, tests, timing, execution, evidence, interaction
   - Run before PR creation

2. **Test evidence generation**
   - Automated screenshot capture
   - Test result documentation
   - Puppeteer verification scripts

## How This Prevents Broken Filters

### Before (How Filters Broke)
1. ❌ No schema verification → wrong data assumptions
2. ❌ No test-first enforcement → claimed "works" without testing
3. ❌ No evidence requirement → lies went undetected
4. ❌ Trust-based system → behavioral issues

### After (How It's Prevented)
1. ✅ Phase 0 forces schema check → catch mismatches early
2. ✅ Can't code without failing tests → test-first enforced
3. ✅ Evidence required at every step → lies impossible
4. ✅ Verification-based system → automated enforcement

## The Key Changes

### From Documentation to Enforcement
- **Before**: "Please test first" (ignorable)
- **After**: "System blocks progress without tests" (enforced)

### From Trust to Verification
- **Before**: "I tested it" (unverifiable claim)
- **After**: "Here's the test output" (verified evidence)

### From Late to Early Detection
- **Before**: User finds broken feature after merge
- **After**: Automated gates prevent broken code from PR

## Quick Reference

### For Every Issue
```bash
# Phase 0 - MANDATORY
cat data/exercises.json | jq '.[0] | keys'  # Check schema FIRST

# Phase 2A - MANDATORY
npx playwright test issue-25 --project=chromium  # Must fail

# Before PR - MANDATORY
./scripts/verify-issue-gates.sh 25  # Must pass all gates
```

### Red Flags That Trigger Blocks
- 🚫 No test files for issue number
- 🚫 Tests passing on first run (not TDD)
- 🚫 No schema verification in scratchpad
- 🚫 No evidence of interaction testing
- 🚫 Data contract mismatches

## The Bottom Line

**You can no longer claim untested features work.**

The system will catch you at:
1. Commit time (pre-commit check)
2. PR creation (verification gate)
3. PR review (automated Phase 0)

This isn't about trust - it's about systematic verification that makes lying impossible.
