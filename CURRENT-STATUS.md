# FitForge Development Status

*Quick mission control - what's done, what's next*

---

## üìç Current State
- **Working MVP**: Dashboard + exercise selection + workout logging + localStorage 
- **Current Focus**: Workout flow improvements (equipment filtering, templates, better UX)
- **Flow Reference**: Complete Mobbin analysis available in `/flows/`
- **Last Session**: Built comprehensive UI pattern library from Fitbod screenshots

---

## ‚úÖ Completed
- **Core Data Flow**: FitbodHome ‚Üí exercise cards ‚Üí WorkoutLoggerEnhanced ‚Üí localStorage ‚úÖ
- **Exercise Database**: 38 exercises with muscle engagement data ‚úÖ
- **Basic Analytics**: Dashboard shows recent workouts, weekly stats ‚úÖ
- **Calm Design System**: ChatGPT's systematic design tokens implemented ‚úÖ
- **Flow Reference Library**: 49 Mobbin flows analyzed with OCR ‚úÖ
- **HDTA Project Scaffolding**: Systematic memory-bank structure with 5 modules ‚úÖ
- **Equipment Filtering**: Portal-based dropdown solution with z-index management ‚úÖ
- **Workout Builder**: Two-column layout with real-time muscle volume visualization ‚úÖ
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live muscle loading calculations with debounced performance ‚úÖ

## üîÑ In Progress  
- **Flow-Driven Realignment**: Updating features to match proven Fitbod UX patterns
- **Workout Templates**: Transform to match Fitbod's routine display pattern (ref: `flows/workout/routine-options/`)
- **Dashboard Redesign**: Follow Fitbod's app structure (ref: `flows/workout/`)

## üìã Flow-Referenced Features & Implementation Guide
- **Template Selector ‚Üí Workout Routine Display**: Reference `flows/workout/routine-options/flow-analysis.md`
  - Shows pre-built routine with muscle groups (Chest, Back, Quadriceps, Abs)
  - Recovery status indicators (100% status bars)
  - Complete exercise list with sets/reps/weight
  - Edit and "Add an exercise" functionality
  - NO category selection screen

- **Dashboard ‚Üí Workout-Centric Navigation**: Reference `flows/workout/flow-analysis.md`
  - "Start Workout" ‚Üí Pre-built routine (not template categories)
  - "View History" ‚Üí Workout log
  - "Analytics" ‚Üí Recovery and progress
  - Remove muscle group cards

- **Equipment Filtering ‚Üí Horizontal Layout**: Reference `flows/workout/adding-an-exercise/filtering-by-available-equipment/flow-analysis.md`
  - Location: Exercise list pages (not dashboard)
  - Layout: "All | Equipment | Target Muscle | Available Equipment | Muscle Fatigue"
  - Visual: Horizontal pill-style filters like Fitbod

- **Set Logging Enhancement**: Reference `flows/workout/routine-options/starting-workout/logging-a-set/flow-analysis.md`
  - Rest timers, progress tracking, completion flows

---

## üéØ Flow-Driven Task Priority
1. **Transform template selector** to match Fitbod's routine pattern (ref: `flows/workout/routine-options/`)  
2. **Redesign dashboard** with Fitbod's app navigation structure (ref: `flows/workout/`)
3. **Relocate equipment filters** to horizontal layout on exercise pages (ref: `flows/workout/adding-an-exercise/filtering-by-available-equipment/`)

---

## üìÅ Key Files
- **Components**: `components/fitbod-home.tsx`, `components/workout-logger-enhanced.tsx`
- **Exercise Data**: `data/exercises-real.json`
- **Flow References**: `flows/FLOW-REFERENCE.md`
- **Styling**: `styles/calm-tokens.css`

## üìö Systematic Planning (when needed)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Stay here for daily development. Only dive deeper when stuck or planning complex features.**
- **Quick commands**: `/task1` (current task), `/equipment` (implementation plan), `/docs` (architecture)
- **Detailed structure**: `flows/memory-bank/` - comprehensive HDTA documentation
- **When to use**: Complex feature planning, architectural decisions, getting unstuck

---

## üîó Legacy Docs
- [Technical Specs](./FitForge-Technical-Specifications.md) - Architecture details
- [Development Guide](./FitForge-Development-Guide.md) - Step-by-step methodology  
- [Style Guide](./FitForge-Style-Guide.md) - Design patterns
- [Flow Reference](./flows/FLOW-REFERENCE.md) - UI pattern library
