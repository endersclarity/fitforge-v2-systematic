# FitForge Development Status

*Quick mission control - what's done, what's next*

---

## 📍 Current State
- **Working MVP**: Dashboard + exercise selection + workout logging + localStorage 
- **Current Focus**: Workout flow improvements (equipment filtering, templates, better UX)
- **Flow Reference**: Complete Mobbin analysis available in `/flows/`
- **Last Session**: Built comprehensive UI pattern library from Fitbod screenshots

---

## ✅ Completed
- **Core Data Flow**: FitbodHome → exercise cards → WorkoutLoggerEnhanced → localStorage ✅
- **Exercise Database**: 38 exercises with muscle engagement data ✅
- **Basic Analytics**: Dashboard shows recent workouts, weekly stats ✅
- **Calm Design System**: ChatGPT's systematic design tokens implemented ✅
- **Flow Reference Library**: 49 Mobbin flows analyzed with OCR ✅
- **HDTA Project Scaffolding**: Systematic memory-bank structure with 5 modules ✅

---

## 🔄 In Progress  
- **Equipment Filtering**: [→ Implementation Details](flows/workout/adding-an-exercise/filtering-by-available-equipment/IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- **Workout Templates**: Replace muscle groups with pre-built routines (Push Day A/B, etc.)
- **Enhanced Set Logging**: Better timer, progress tracking, rest periods

---

## 🎯 Next 3 Tasks
1. **Add equipment filters** to exercise selection (reference: `flows/workout/adding-an-exercise/filtering-by-available-equipment/`)
2. **Implement workout templates** instead of muscle group cards (reference: `flows/workout/routine-options/`)  
3. **Improve set logging UX** with timers and progress indicators (reference: `flows/workout/routine-options/starting-workout/logging-a-set/`)

## 📁 Key Files
- **Components**: `components/fitbod-home.tsx`, `components/workout-logger-enhanced.tsx`
- **Exercise Data**: `data/exercises-real.json`
- **Flow References**: `flows/FLOW-REFERENCE.md`
- **Styling**: `styles/calm-tokens.css`

## 📚 Systematic Planning (when needed)
⚠️ **Stay here for daily development. Only dive deeper when stuck or planning complex features.**
- **Quick commands**: `/task1` (current task), `/equipment` (implementation plan), `/docs` (architecture)
- **Detailed structure**: `flows/memory-bank/` - comprehensive HDTA documentation
- **When to use**: Complex feature planning, architectural decisions, getting unstuck
